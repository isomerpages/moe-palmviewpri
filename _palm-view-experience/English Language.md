The department believes in building a strong foundation in effective language use and communication for all our students. We adopt a systematic approach to the teaching of language skills. Teachers make use of rich texts and a variety of platforms to develop and strengthen language proficiency.

###### Pedagogy

The core features of our EL classrooms include: STELLAR (Strategies for the Teaching of English Language and Reading), shared book approach, explicit teaching of vocabulary and grammar, modified language experience approach and learning centres. 

To encourage and support our students in their writing, we make use of the Picture Word Induction Method (PWIM). This is a multifaceted approach which allows students to “increase sight-word and writing vocabularies, phonetic and structural analysis, and use observation and analysis in their study of reading and writing” (Calhoun, 1999). Through careful selection of pictures which are aligned to the books covered within STELLAR, students build on their vocabulary skills by making meaningful connections between aural and written words. To build a strong foundation in the other language areas, our teachers design specific lessons, activities and packages that emphasise on introducing, reinforcing, applying and extending the learning of concepts and skills. This allows for a comprehensive and in-depth learning of the English Language.

###### Media Resource Library

Our library is a great place of learning for the students. Our department teachers work closely with the various departments to facilitate the many activities conducted at the library. The activities range from whole school to specific learning groups. Teachers come up with creative themes and transform the library into vibrant learning spaces for the students. We work closely with our parent volunteers to carry out activities like Reading Mums, games and storytelling sessions to increase our students’ love for reading. Our teachers take their students into the library to conduct lessons and activities. The library is equipped with books of varied genres and facilitates bulk borrowing to ensure that every student is provided with opportunities to read within and beyond the classroom.
