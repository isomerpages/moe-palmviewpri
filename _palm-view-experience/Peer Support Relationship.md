<p><strong><u>Peer Support Relationships @ Palm View Primary</u></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Peer Support Relationships (PSR) initiative builds on our school’s culture
of care. It aims to create a supportive and caring environment so that
our students will feel safe, accepted and empowered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This leads to positive child &amp; youth development and risk prevention,
as well as improved student learning and academic achievement.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The three domains of PSR are:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Peer Bonding</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peer Helping</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peer Influencing</p>
</li>
</ol>

their peers. Some of these skills include:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>

<p>How to befriend their peers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to be a better friend&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Peer Support Leaders (PSLs), on the other hand, will go through specialised
training to take on a leadership role in school and lead the peer support
efforts. They will also be supported by the PSL teachers, the School Counsellor,
Special Needs Officers and the Student Management Department.&nbsp;</p>
