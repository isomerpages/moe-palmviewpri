## PAL (OUTDOOR EDUCATION)

Programmed for Active Learning (PAL) is a major initiative to address the need for greater emphasis on non-academic programmes for all P1 & P2 pupils. It encompasses learning in a creative way and provides opportunities for pupils to participate and create in fun and enjoyable activities, while learning how to be an effective member of a group in achieving a common objective.

  

PAL – Outdoor Education focuses on connecting pupils to the natural environment.  The connecting themes of “I’m with Nature” (P1) and “Nature’s Wonders” (P2) focuses on developing their understanding and awareness of nature and its importance in their lives. The activities provide avenues for pupils to learn and understand the importance of being good stewards of the earth while developing their social and emotional competencies.
