###### Palm View Challenge (PVC) – A Leader, An Advocate, A Force For Good

Palm View Challenge is a 6-year school-wide programme designed in line with different learning experiences aimed at developing children’s life skills, values and social emotional competencies. Students at each level are challenged to complete different tasks, each carefully designed to develop in them desirable character traits for the 21st century. By the end of our students’ 6-year journey with the school, we aim to provide them with a holistic development in the cognitive, physical, social and moral domains.
