###### Curriculum
The Primary Mathematics syllabus aims to enable all students to: 

acquire mathematical concepts and skills for everyday use and continuous learning in mathematics; develop thinking, reasoning, communication, application and metacognition skills through a mathematical approach to problem solving; and build confidence and foster interest in mathematics.   

In Palm View Primary, we endeavor to build a strong foundation in numeracy in our students and to arouse interest in mathematics learning.  There are programmes within curriculum and outside curriculum time to help students master basic concepts as well as to encourage them to think critically, reason logically and communicate effectively.

###### Problem Solving
The central focus of the curriculum is the development of mathematical problem-solving skills. Therefore, students are taught general problem-solving strategies and ways of thinking and approaching a problem. Polya’s 4-steps for problem solving is a useful framework for students to know and use. Palm View Primary has modified it to make it simpler for our younger students to understand. 

Some of our school strategies: 

RIGHT: Read the question, Identify Key words, Get a plan, Have it done, Triple check 

MEWAS: Model, Equation, Working, Answer, Statement 

NTUC: Number transfer, units, calculation

Explicit teaching of heuristics and reasoning and communication skills will also be taught to enable our students to become better problem solvers.

###### Learning Experience
There is a deliberate effort to enhance the learning experience of our students to foster joy of learning. In class, mathematics lessons are designed with learning experience activities for students to learn mathematical concepts through games and class activities. Lower primary students also get to experience a virtual learning journey to River Safari during curriculum time. During our week of Math carnival, students will get additional opportunities to participate in activities and games during recess when they learn through exploration and fun.

###### Use of Technology
The school uses the affordance of ICT to help students to understand mathematical concepts using videos and other visualisations. Students are encouraged to use Student Learning Space (SLS) to communicate ideas and collaborate with one another as part of their knowledge building process.

###### Enrichment Programmes  
The school plans enrichment programmes for upper primary students with an aptitude for mathematics. Selected P4 and P5 students will also be invited to join the E2K programme. There are various competitions that selected students can participate in. Some of these  mathematics competitions are Singapore Mathematical Olympiad for Primary Schools (SMOPS), National Mathematical Olympiad of Singapore (NMOS) and Annual Mathlympics.
