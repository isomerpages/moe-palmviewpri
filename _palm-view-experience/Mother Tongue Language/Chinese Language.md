The Chinese Language (CL) Department aims to develop students into confident and competent Chinese Language users who are able to appreciate their own culture.

###### Department Mission <br>
Providing quality teaching to develop students into proficient users of Chinese Language who can communicate effectively with others, appreciate Chinese culture and acquire knowledge and wisdom through the language.

###### Department Vision <br>
Engaged learner who loves the language, proficient user who communicates well.  
  
###### Department Key Thrusts <br>
In order to achieve our mission and vision, the Chinese Department is underpinned by 4 key strategic thrusts, namely _Customized Curriculum, Effective Pedagogies, Accurate Assessments, and Supportive Programmes_. The 4 areas complement each other to benefit students’ learning.

1. **Customized Curriculum** <br>
The Department is fully aware of the diversified learning needs of our students. Some students may use Mandarin very frequently at home, while some may rarely speak Mandarin at home. Some students are visual learners, while some are kinetic learners. Aligning with MOE’s syllabus, the Department adopted the modular system (Bridging, Core and Enrichment) which caters to different learning needs of our students. Each module adopts different strategies to maximize students’ potential in learning the Chinese Language. Appropriate learning resources such as spelling lists, supplementary worksheets and writing tasks are also thoughtfully designed to reinforce students’ learning and build their confidence.

2. **Effective Pedagogies** <br>
In order to make our students learn well, the Department adopts various pedagogies to make learning Chinese Language fun and effective. _ICT-integrated Lesson_ appeals to students’ interest and leverages on multiple online resources such as Xuele and iMTL Portal to promote self-directed learning and collaborative learning. _Drama-based Lessons_ makes lessons come alive and deepens students’ understanding in comprehension and composition. _Oral Interactive Lessons_ provides structured approach to improve students’ oral communication skills. _Word-Rationale Pedagogy_ makes learning of Chinese characters interesting and fun and at the same time nurtures creative spirits of our students.

3. **Accurate Assessments** <br>
Information gathered from our assessments enable us to understanding students’ learning needs better. Apart from summative assessments (formal exams) which provides us data to analyse students’ achievements in learning, structured formative assessments (informal test) provides timely information on how well students have managed listening, speaking, reading and writing skills. Teachers also applied formative assessment principles in their daily teaching to monitor individual student’s progress. The Department strives to conduct every assessment accurately to know our students well.

4. **Supportive Programmes** <br>
Besides learning from textbooks, the Department also designed and implemented a number of programmes to support students’ learning of the language and culture. These programmes also provided platforms for students to showcase their talents in Chinese Language and apply their learning in an authentic environment. Here are some our signature programmes:

Major Programmes

2.  **Mother Tongue Language Fortnight and Cultural Camp** <br>
