## APPLIED LEARNING PROGRAMME

 Voyagers@PLVPS is Palm View Primary School's Applied Learning Programme (ALP), fostering 21st Century Competencies (21CC) through experiential learning. Grounded in Design Thinking and Constructionism principles, the programme empowers students to tackle real-world challenges, experiment with ideas, and develop innovative solutions.

At the heart of Voyagers@PLVPS is the conviction that every child possesses the capacity to be a curious learner, problem solver, and creative thinker. Through integrated projects and maker challenges, students apply cross-disciplinary knowledge spanning English, Mathematics, Science, and Art. They harness both traditional and digital tools—from LEGO and recyclable materials to 3D pens, Micro:bits, and 3D printers—to create prototypes and transform their ideas into tangible solutions. This blend of physical and digital creation strengthens students' technological competencies while developing essential 21st-century skills such as critical, adaptive and inventive thinking, collaboration and information skills, and digital competencies.

Central to Voyagers@PLVPS is the Design Thinking Framework for Young Voyagers—a student-centred approach guiding learners through a structured yet imaginative process of problem-solving and innovation. This framework, tailored to primary school students' developmental needs, nurtures them to become empathetic tinkerers and changemakers of tomorrow.

One of the key strengths of Voyagers@PLVPS lies in its intentional integration of subject areas, allowing students to make meaningful connections across disciplines while engaging in creative problem-solving and hands-on making.
