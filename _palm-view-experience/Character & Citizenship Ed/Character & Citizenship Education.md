**Mission**&nbsp;

To develop the whole child to be a force for good in the world.

Palm View Primary School believes that every student can be nurtured to be a force for good in the world. Thus, we plan programmes to inculcate values and build competencies in our students to develop them to be good individuals and useful citizens.

Our key drivers for Character &amp; Citizenship Education are the: <br>

* National Education Programme
* CCE (FTGP) Curriculum

**Social Studies** <br>
At the heart of the Singapore Social Studies (SS) curriculum is the preparation of our students to be citizens of tomorrow by helping them to better understand the interconnectedness in Singapore and the world they live in, and appreciate the complexities of the human experience. <br>
SS seeks to inculcate in students a deeper understanding of the values that define the Singapore society, nurture dispositions that will inspire them to show concern for the world they live in, and demonstrate empathy in their relationships with others.

In Palm View, a blended approach is used in the enactment of the SS curriculum. Students are exposed to digital storybooks and online activities that may include virtual tours to experience the historical, social and cultural contexts of Singapore.

**National Education Programme** <br>
National Education (NE) is part of our holistic education. It strives to develop students to be concerned citizens who stay rooted to Singapore. Holistic learning experiences are created through NE Commemorative Days which are linked to important points in Singapore’s history. Cohort experiences such as level camps, P5 NE Show and P6 Asian Civilisations Museum provide opportunities to cultivate a sense of belonging to Singapore.

**CCE (FTGP) Curriculum** <br>
As Form Teachers (FTs) play a central role in shaping the holistic development of students, the Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) has been introduced in all primary schools since 2012. <br>
&nbsp;The objectives of FTGP are to:&nbsp;<br>
\- provide quality interaction time between form teachers and students, and <br>
\- equip students with social and emotional competencies.

In Palm View, FTGP is conducted from 8.00 a.m. – 9.00 a.m. on Tuesdays for all levels. Form Teachers conduct explicit teaching of Social and Emotional competencies to equip students with self-awareness, social awareness, self-management, relationship management and responsible decision-making skills. In addition, Form Teachers bond with students through interaction activities within the period. One-to-one student interaction is also conducted within this period.

**Education and Career Guidance Programme** <br>
Students are guided with their career plans and choices through the school’s Education and Career Guidance Programme. The&nbsp; P5 students are given access to the Career Guidance Portal and guided through exposure to the various secondary school choices and industries available. In Palm View, the experience is further enhanced through our R3ICH for Your Dreams Programme, a week-long Education and Career Guidance (ECG) programme which enriches our students’ career awareness and aspirations through the learning of work values from the various professions in the real world. Parents are invited to share their occupations via videos and students were encouraged to dress in their dream occupation.

Our P6s get to interact with selected speakers to learn more about their occupations and their daily work during the annual Career Seminar Day.

**Values in Action (VIA) Programme** <br>
Students are encouraged to display positive traits and internalise the values through our level-based and school-wide programmes.&nbsp;

The school-wide programmes include the training&nbsp;<br>
• VIA Monitors <br>
• Wipe Down @ The Classroom <br>
• Wipe Down @ The Canteen <br>

The level-based programmes are designed in alignment with the head, heart and hands approach. Thus, the students not only feel a sense of empathy for another individual but are inspired to make the community a better place for everyone.
