<p>Besides setting aside curriculum time within CCE (FTGP) lessons for the
four NE Commemorative Days - Total Defence Day, International Friendship

experiences through multiple learning platforms i.e. assembly programme,

<p><strong>Inspiring RᵌICH League Award</strong>
</p>
<p>The 3-tier Inspiring R³ICH League Awards celebrate students and classes
who consistently demonstrate Palm View Primary School’s R³ICH values —
Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Care and Harmony. The programme
affirms positive behaviours and actions that contribute to a safe and nurturing
learning environment.</p>
<p>The Star Student Award recognises students who not only live out our R³ICH
values through their actions, but also inspire others through their exemplary
behaviour.</p>
<p>The Class Challenge Award is presented to classes that display strong
teamwork in maintaining high standards of behaviour and cleanliness.</p>
<p>The Silent Hero Award honours students who quietly embody our R³ICH values
without seeking attention or praise — our everyday heroes chosen by school
leaders, teachers and staff.</p>

<p><strong>A Resilient Me</strong>
</p>
<p>Mental well-being is key to overall health and development. A Resilient
Me is a joint collaboration between Character and Citizenship Education
(CCE) and Student Mangement (SM) Departments to build a school culture
where students feel safe and supported through promoting positive mindsets
and mental well-being. Peer Suport Leaders and Prefects introduce monthly
mental resilience quotes and explicit teaching on the applications of the
quotes in learning is taught during morning Engagement Time. Students take
on monthly resilience challenges, helping them build stronger coping skills
and adapt more effectively to challenges.</p>

<p><strong>RᵌICH for Your Dreams</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>RᵌICH For Your Dreams is one of the CCE’s signature programmes which took
place in the last week of Term 2. The programme's objectives centered on
fostering students' self-awareness and expanding their knowledge of diverse
education and career pathways. The aim was to empower students to make
informed decisions regarding their educational and career pursuits, considering
their individual strengths, interests, and skills.</p>
<p>To engage students in their journey of career exploration, fun-filled
recess activities were prepared. The highlight of the week was ‘Dress for
Success’ where staff and students came decked out in their dream occupation
attire, complete with accessories. Witnessing the participants embodying
their aspirations was not only encouraging but also deeply inspiring.</p>

<p><strong>P6 Career Day</strong>
</p>
<p>As part of the Education and Career Guidance (ECG) Programme, the P6 Career
Day aims to enrich our graduating cohort with understanding of career possibilities
and encourage our students to explore their interests and strengths as
they contemplate their future careers. Students will have the opportunity
to engage with distinguished guest speakers from diverse fields. These
professionals will share their experiences and insights, providing meaningful
perspectives on the different career paths available to them.</p>
