<p><strong>NE Commemorative Days</strong>
</p>
<p>Besides setting aside curriculum time within CCE (FTGP) lessons for the
four NE Commemorative Days - Total Defence Day, International Friendship
Day, Racial Harmony Day and National Day, students are engaged in learning
experiences through multiple learning platforms i.e. assembly programme,
classroom and recess activities to internalise values and citizenship dispositions.</p>
