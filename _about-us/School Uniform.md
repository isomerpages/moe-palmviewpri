## School Uniform
**School Uniform** <br>
Students are to wear the prescribed school uniform and PE attire. Modification to the uniform is strictly not allowed. They are to wear the school uniform with plain white shoes and socks.

The school has introduced coloured name tags for each incoming cohort since 2018. This provides a unique identity for each level and builds a sense of belonging for our students.
