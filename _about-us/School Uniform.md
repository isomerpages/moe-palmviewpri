## School Uniform
**School Uniform** <br>
Students are to wear the prescribed school uniform and PE attire. Modification to the uniform is strictly not allowed. They are to wear the school uniform with plain white shoes and socks.

The school has introduced coloured name tags for each incoming cohort since 2018. This provides a unique identity for each level and builds a sense of belonging for our students. The coloured name tags for the 2020 Primary 1 students will be grey.

**Physical Education (PE) Attire**<br>
Students are allowed to wear the schoolâ€™s PE attire i.e. school t-shirt and shorts/skort only on days when they have PE lessons, CCA (sports-related), PAL lessons, learning journeys or enrichment programmes and they may remain in that attire throughout the day.   

For a start, to ease our P1 students into formal education, the school will begin with a 2-in-1 concept where the PE attire will be worn as the daily uniform and serve to be the attire for PE and outdoor lessons.
