## SCHOOL SONG

<p align="center"> Rise up Palm View let your voice be heard,
<br>
the siren beckons our flag unfurled.
<br>
Our school is calling us to make a stand,
<br>
Let us unite be the best we can.
<br>
Stand up Palm View let your spirits soar,
<br>
treasures around us to be sought
<br>
Lessons unknown hidden in the breeze
<br>
waiting for young minds their riches glean.
<br>
(Chorus) With curious minds and caring hearts,
<br>
Creative spirits this sets us apart
<br>
Inspiring excellence, a force for good.
<br>
Reach out Palm View let your heart be stirred,
<br>
Love and kindness in every word
<br>
Give of yourself to serve and lead
<br>
Be true to every man in word and deed.
<br>
(Chorus) With curious minds and caring hearts,
<br>
Creative spirits this sets us apart
<br>
Inspiring excellence, a force for good.
<br>
(Chorus) With curious minds and caring hearts,
<br>
Creative spirits this sets us apart
<br>
Inspiring excellence, a force for good.
