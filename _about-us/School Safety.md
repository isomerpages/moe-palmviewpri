Safety Begins with Me
---------------------

A good learning experience can only take place when all students are in a safe and secure learning environment, and this is one guiding principle that the school lives by. Our school staff are regularly on the ground to ensure that safety is observed at all times, and the school structures are given regular checks and reviews to ensure the safety integrity of the school is not compromised. Regular upgrading is carried out to the safety and security features around and in the school.

More crucially, our children are educated to remember that in all instances, 'Safety begins with Me' - reminding themselves that they can manage their own safety when they observe all safety rules. Such reminders are carried out during termly assembly talks and during FTGP lessons.

  

A Safe Route to School
----------------------

Safety as a primary concern does not just revolve around safety practices in the school as it extends to what happens outside the school. That is why emphasis is also placed on the way the children make their way to school. Kindly refer to the [Safe Route to School.pdf](/files/Safe%20Route%20to%20School.pdf) on the available routes to school and the safety precautions when plying by these routes.  
  

Cyberspace Safety
-----------------

The mission to equip students with life-long social and emotional competencies along with sound values so that they can become safe, respectful and responsible netizens or technology users guides the key approach to Cyber Wellness (CW). 

  

According to MOE CW framework, the three principles, ‘Respect for Self and Others’, ‘Safe and Responsible Use’ and ‘Positive Peer Influence’ when adhered to, will enable students to make careful and well-considered decisions when they are in cyberspace.

School Emergency Preparedness (EP)
----------------------------------

The school has procedures in place to respond to and take appropriate measures corresponding to the severity and extent of any impending emergencies. Each year, two emergency exercises will be conducted to equip our staff and students with the necessary knowledge and skills to respond in the event of an emergency. 

Do refer to the SGSecure website, [www.sgsecure.sg](http://www.sgsecure.sg/), for more information on the community’s response to the threat of terrorism. SGSecure is a national movement to sensitise, train and mobilise Singaporeans to play a part to prevent and deal with a terrorist attack. It is our community’s response to safeguard our way of life against terrorism and community strife. 

  

Thank you for the support and together, we strengthen our civil defence by taking care of our friends, family and people around us in times of crisis.
