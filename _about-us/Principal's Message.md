## PRINCIPAL'S MESSAGE

At Palm View Primary School, we have always believed in the power of authentic, hands-on learning and out-of-classroom experiences to inspire our students. In 2024, we were excited to **reposition our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) into a dynamic Maker Education STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) curriculum**. This transition aims to empower our students with essential skills in creativity, critical thinking, problem-solving and prepare them to thrive in an ever-evolving world.

Our journey into Maker Education began in late 2023 with the launch of _Voyagers@PLVPS_, an initiative designed to infuse creativity and innovation into everyday learning. By shifting our ALP to a Maker Education framework, we believe that students should not only acquire knowledge but also actively create, innovate and shape the world around them.

_Voyagers@PLVPS_ fosters collaboration amongst interdisciplinary projects that link science, Environmental Education, Mathematics, Languages and digital-making to real-world problem-solving. Students work together to experiment, iterate, and innovate, and this approach nurtures curiosity, embraces challenges and creates an environment where students are empowered to take ownership of their learning. This shift underscores our commitment to preparing students for a future where technology and creativity intersect.

Our school’s efforts received recognition when Channel News Asia (CNA) featured our students’ projects during a commemorative National Day coverage on social media, celebrating their creativity in Maker Education. Our teachers were also invited to share their insights and success story at the MOE Educational Technology Division (ETD) Maker Symposium, inspiring educators from other schools.

Alongside our Maker Education initiatives, our students also showcased their diverse talents at the **Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Central Judging Platform.** The **Modern Dance CCA was recognised with a Certificate of Distinction**, demonstrating their dedication, discipline, and creative expression through movement. The **Choir CCA was recognized with a Certificate of Accomplishment**, highlighting their teamwork, vocal proficiency and musicality. Through their performances, our student performers contributed to Singapore’s rich cultural landscape while demonstrating the importance of the arts in our education. These accomplishments reflect our belief in a holistic education that values both academic achievement and artistic growth, positioning our students as active contributors to the cultural fabric of our nation.

As we look ahead to 2025, we remain committed to refining and expanding our signature programmes to inspire the next generation of innovators, creators, and problem-solvers. Central to our efforts is the realisation of the Palm View Graduand Outcomes: _Resilient Learners, Adaptable Thinkers, Empathetic Leaders and Reflective Communicators_. These core values are integrated into every aspect of our school’s initiatives, ensuring that our students develop the skills necessary to navigate an increasingly complex world.

Through our commitment to hands-on learning, creativity and collaboration, we are confident that our students are developing the skills and mindsets they will need to succeed in tomorrow’s world. As we celebrate the successes of our students, we remain committed to empowering the next generation to make a positive impact in the world and be that ‘Force for Good’, nurturing the leaders and changemakers of the future. We look forward to partnering parents to continue this journey together in 2025 and beyond.
