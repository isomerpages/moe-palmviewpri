## PRINCIPAL'S MESSAGE

It is the mission and calling of Palm View Primary School to provide a student-centric, values-driven and holistic education for all students. In this current VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, Ambiguous) world and environment, it is imperative that we provide meaningful life experiences for students, both in and out of the classroom, ones that will imbue them with values and competencies that will put them in good stead as they journey through life.

Over the past few years, the Ministry of Education has unveiled a series of broad changes within the education landscape which include relooking at assessment for lower Primary students as well as those in the transition years in middle and upper Primary.  The changes are part of the _Learn for Life_ movement, one that rallies educators and stakeholders to prepare our students to excel beyond examination results. To us at Palm View, by preparing our students to _Learn for Life_, we provide a range of programmes and activities to build character in our students, to excite their various senses, to encourage them to innovate and be creative and to learn to have fun and enjoy their formative years in Primary school. One signature programme at Palm View that has been instrumental in preparing our students to _Learn for Life_ is the school’s _Palm View Challenge: A Leader. An Advocate. A Force for Good._ We are proud to share the news that the Palm View Challenge has been accorded the Ministry of Education’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP) status.

Our students have been provided with the opportunities to explore and develop their interests and strengths, engage in deep learning and apply their learning in real-world contexts to make a difference in their areas of passion. It is our hope that experiencing the _Joy of Learning_ will lead to deep learning and mastery and in turn, build the foundation for lifelong learning for our students.

We are immensely proud of our students, our Palm View ambassadors, who represent the school in various competitions and platforms, flying the Palm View flag high. Regardless of the outcome of their participation, our young ambassadors have demonstrated resilience, moral courage, grit and teamwork through their endeavours. It is our wish that these students serve as an inspiration to others in the school community and the school has continually recognised these students at internal platforms in order for them to be role models for their peers.

As we forge ahead, the school looks forward to engaging parents through various platforms and we thank you for your continued support and partnership as we journey together in bringing out the best in our children.
