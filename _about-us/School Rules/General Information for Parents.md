### School Safety and Security

For safety and security reasons, visitors are not allowed to go beyond the General Office unattended. Please obtain a security label at the Security Post before making your way to the General Office. The staff at the General Office will assist you.

### Sense of Responsibility

In line with our school’s R3ICH values of responsibility and resilience, do encourage your child/ward to pack their own school bag. With the exception of a medical emergency, the school will not entertain requests from parents/guardians to send items to students. We seek your understanding and cooperation in working with the school in this matter.

### Communication with Staff of the School

Parents/guardians may need to communicate with your child/ward’s teachers regarding his/her progress and homework from time to time. Please make an appointment with the respective teacher(s) before coming to the school to meet them as teachers may be teaching or engaged in other school activities.

Alternatively, parents/guardians may write an email to your child’s teacher(s). The teachers will respond to your queries within 3 school days.

### Announcements

The school will keep parents/guardians informed of school programmes and updates via communication channels such as the Palm View Connection, letters, Parents Gateway and SMS for urgent matters. Students are also expected to be attentive to the announcements made in the morning or in class so that they can relate accurate information to their parents/guardians.
