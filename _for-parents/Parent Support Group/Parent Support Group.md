Supportive PSG members can help to make the school a safe place for our children to learn and play in, making school life more vibrant and engaging. The PSG also volunteers their  expertise, talents, individual interests and creative ideas to support the school for programme improvements. The more experienced parents also can share their experience and advice with new parents.
