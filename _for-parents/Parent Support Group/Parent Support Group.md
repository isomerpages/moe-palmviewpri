Supportive&nbsp;PSG&nbsp;members can help to make the school a safe place for our children to learn and play in, making school life more vibrant and engaging.&nbsp;The&nbsp;PSG&nbsp;also volunteers their&nbsp; expertise, talents, individual interests and creative ideas to support the school for programme&nbsp;improvements.&nbsp;The more experienced parents also can share their experience and advice with new parents.
