# Infocomm Club
The Infocomm Club CCA presents an exhilarating opportunity for students to delve into their interest in media content creation. The programme will provide a comprehensive understanding of photography and videography fundamentals, as well as exposure to emerging technologies. Practical assignments will enable students to apply their skills, fostering creativity, collaboration, and instructor feedback. The curriculum will also emphasize the importance of observing the surroundings, engaging with individuals while capturing content, assuming responsibility for their equipment and artistic decisions, and developing resilience through the creative process.
