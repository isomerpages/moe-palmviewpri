## ART CLUB

**IMAGE NOT ATTACHED IN ORIGINAL SITE**<BR>
The art club aims to develop visual literate students, they will be able to observe, understand and make meaning of what they see. They will be able to communicate their ideas by using and creating visuals. We want them to be able to see the value and recognise the relevance of art in their lives.  

Students will be exposed to various art forms and mediums such as drawing, painting, mixed media, clay and craft. Through the inquiry based learning process, students will gain a better understanding of art concepts and ideas. 

Students will be exposed to different art styles, artists and art movements through visits to art galleries and museums.
