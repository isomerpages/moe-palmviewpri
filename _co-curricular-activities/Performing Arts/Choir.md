#### Overview
The Choir CCA aims to develop students’ potential in singing, performing skills and character development. It strives to instill the school values of Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Care and Harmony in the members of the choir through musical exposure and experiences provided through various platforms.

#### Learning Outcomes

During practice sessions, the members of the choir learn a repertoire of songs, choral techniques and character development under the guidance of their instructor and teachers. 

Choir members will get to perform in various school events and celebrations. Members of the choir are also given the opportunity to attend learning journeys to learn from other professional choirs. 

To continually develop their talents and hone their showmanship skills, there are also external platforms provided such as attending workshops, exchange programmes and participating in joint choir concerts with other schools. 

In view of the pandemic for the past 2 years, Choir has pivoted to online platforms through eCCA as all masked and unmasked singing is not allowed. We are looking forward to resume singing activities soon. 

Through these experiences, choristers develop confidence and continually strive to pursue choral excellence.
