## MODERN DANCE

**Overview** <br>
The modern dance CCA aims to expose students to the art form of dance through an enriching and engaging way. Students will be given the opportunity to creatively explore genres such as hip hop and contemporary dance. The CCA will challenge them to step out of their comfort zone and strive towards excellence.

**Learning Outcomes** <br>
Students will learn to explore dance and the movements that come with it and develop an understanding of the artistic and technical elements of physical expression.

They will learn team dynamics through choreography and increase awareness of their surroundings through formation changes.

Most importantly, through the challenging and physically demanding nature of dance, students will grow in resilience, perseverance and discipline.
