## TABLE TENNIS

**Overview**

Riding on the 2008 Olympic success of Singapore in attaining a silver medal for&nbsp;table&nbsp;tennis, Palm View hopes to capitalise this renewed fervour in the sport to inspire our children to do their best and aspire to one day represent the nation in an international sporting event. &nbsp;&nbsp;

The core purpose of the&nbsp;Table&nbsp;Tennis&nbsp;CCA in Palm View Primary School is to instil personal discipline through the rigour of&nbsp;table&nbsp;tennis. A developmental approach to skill acquisition will undergird the training programme, with repeated practices on the correct skills so as to be truly competent.&nbsp; Through the CCA, the children will also learn that the same rules apply beyond&nbsp;table&nbsp;tennis&nbsp;and school, that to be truly exemplary at something, hard work and repeated effort needs to be put in. This aligns ourselves to the school’s motto to ‘Inspire Excellence’.

**Learning Outcomes**

From the CCA, pupils will be able to:

*   **Learn**&nbsp;the rules, different styles of play and discipline that is required to play a proper game of&nbsp;table&nbsp;tennis.
*   **Gain**&nbsp;exposure to the wider&nbsp;table&nbsp;tennis&nbsp;world through internal and external competitions, as well as exposure lessons on how&nbsp;table&nbsp;tennis&nbsp;came about.
