## BADMINTON

Badminton is a Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) which started in 2021. Through our training programme, we aim to develop discipline, commitment and fair play in our students. With guidance from our dedicated coaches and teachers, we hope that students can achieve a higher level of proficiency of badminton skills. With improved knowledge and skills, we hope that our students can develop greater passion for the game and&nbsp;become lifelong active&nbsp;citizens.  

**Learning Outcomes**

Badminton is a sport that requires technique, agility, hand-eye coordination and tactical thinking. In Palm View Primary, we want our students to not only develop interest for the sport, but also acquire the skills needed to play a good game of badminton. The Badminton CCA also provides a platform for students to display the school’s R3ICH values of Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Care and Harmony. Through friendly matches and inter-school competitions, we also hope to instill in our students other important values such as sportsmanship and excellence.

&nbsp;Students will:

* &nbsp;acquire knowledge about the basic rules of badminton.
* learn proper skills and techniques including basic footwork and strokes.
* build their character through various opportunities to display our school’s R<sup>3</sup>ICH values.
