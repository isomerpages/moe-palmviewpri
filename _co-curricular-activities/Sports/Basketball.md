#### Overview
As one of the pioneer Co – Curricular Activities (CCAs) in Palm View Primary School, Basketball was introduced into our CCA stable in 2015 as a means to promote values through sports. The discipline and rigour required to develop the Sportsboys and Sportsgirls in our children augurs well with our motto to Inspire Excellence, and it is with this that we hope that our children will be able to become basketballers who have curious minds, caring hearts and creative spirits – basketballers who become a force for good in the world.

Within the Basketball CCA for Palm View Primary School, the children will be given ample and dedicated training on the skills required to develop their competencies in playing the sport. The larger context that guides the CCA is to cultivate sporting awareness and excellence through the playing of basketball.
